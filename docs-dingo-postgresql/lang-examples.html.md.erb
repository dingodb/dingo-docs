title: Example applications for Dingo PostgreSQL™
---

The community of Cloud Foundry & PostgreSQL users have created some example applications that can bind to Dingo PostgreSQL™ service credentials.

| Language | Source Code |
| --- | --- |
| Java/Spring | [Spring Music](https://github.com/scottfrederick/spring-music) |
| Node.js | [Ghost blogging platform](https://github.com/dingotiles/ghost-for-cloudfoundry) |

## Java/Spring

Cloud Foundry documentation includes a section on [Configure Service Connections for Spring](http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/buildpacks/java/spring-service-bindings.html).

[Spring Music](https://github.com/scottfrederick/spring-music) is sample application for using database services on Cloud Foundry with Spring Framework.

```
git clone https://github.com/scottfrederick/spring-music
cd spring-music
./gradlew assemble
cf push
cf cs dingo-postgresql cluster spring-music-pg
cf bs spring-music spring-music-pg
cf restart spring-music
```


## Node.js

Use https://www.npmjs.org/package/cfenv ([source code](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/node-cfenv)) to discover service binding credentials to Dingo PostgreSQL™.

See the example application [Ghost blogging platform](https://github.com/dingotiles/ghost-for-cloudfoundry) (modified from Ghost v0.7.8 release).

Assuming you have bound a service with `pg` in its name:

```
var env = process.env.NODE_ENV || 'development';
var production = env == 'production';

var appEnv = {};
var sqlCredentials = {};
if (production) {
  var cfEnv = require("cfenv");
  var appEnv = cfEnv.getAppEnv();
  var sqlCredentials = appEnv.getService(/pg/).credentials;
}
console.log(sqlCredentials);
```

The `appEnv.getService(/pg/)` command will look for the first binding whose service name matches the regular expression `/pg/`.

## Ruby on Rails

Dingo PostgreSQL™ is built to integrate cleanly with the [ruby-buildpack](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/ruby-buildpack) and its [expected service bindings](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/buildpacks/ruby/ruby-service-bindings.html).

At runtime, the Ruby buildpack creates a `$DATABASE_URL` environment variable.
