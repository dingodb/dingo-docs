title: Pre-tutorial preparation
---

When preparing for the tutorials, it can be desirable to delete all running containers/service instances.

To clean out the Cloud Foundry database of service instances:

```
cf purge-service-offering dingo-postgresql
cf update-service-broker dingo-postgresql USER PASS URL
cf enable-service-access dingo-postgresql
```

To clean out Dingo PostgreSQL of all running containers/service instances:

```
bosh --ca-cert /var/tempest/workspaces/default/root_ca_certificate target OPS-MANAGER-DIRECTOR-IP
bosh login

bosh deployment /var/tempest/workspaces/default/deployments/dingo-postgresql-*.yml
name=$(bosh deployments | grep dingo-postgresql- | awk '{print $2}')
echo $name
bosh delete deployment $name
bosh -n deploy
```

If you want to be very bold, empty out the object storage buckets. This makes it easier to spot newly created backup items during the tutorials.

```
sudo apt-get install awscli
aws configure
```

To find the names of the buckets being used:

```
grep bucket /var/tempest/workspaces/default/deployments/dingo-postgresql-*.yml
```

Then for the two buckets in the deployment:

```
aws s3 rm s3://our-dingo-postgresql-wal-backups --recursive
aws s3 rm s3://our-dingo-postgresql-clusterdata --recursive
```
