title: Provison new Service Instance from backups
---

Dingo PostgreSQL provides users with `cf create-service ... -c '{"clone-from":"NAME"}'` to recreate a deleted service instance or clone an existing service instance into a new service instance.

To clone an existing service instance into a new service instance (`prod` and `staging` respectively in example below):

```
cf create-service dingo-postgresql cluster prod
cf create-service dingo-postgresql cluster staging -c '{"clone-from":"prod"}'
```

To recreate a deleted service instance:

```
cf delete-service dingo-postgresql cluster prod
cf create-service dingo-postgresql cluster prod -c '{"clone-from":"prod"}'
```

In each example, Dingo PostgreSQL looks thru the history of all service instances to find the backups for the most recent service instance named `prod` in the same Cloud Foundry organization/space.

Provisioning a new service instance based on a cloned backup will take longer than provisioning a brand new service instance. The additional steps automatically performed are:

* discovery of the most recent service instance that had the `clone-from` target name (`prod` in the examples above)
* cloning/copying all the base backups and write-ahead logs (WAL) within the backup object storage service
* start up the highly-available cluster of PostgreSQL servers
* PostgreSQL leader server restores the most recent base backup and subsequent WAL files
* PostgreSQL leader creates fresh base backup
* PostgreSQL replica replicates from either leader or backups
