title: Using PostGIS
---

[PostGIS](http://postgis.net/) is a spatial database extender for PostgreSQL object-relational database. It adds support for geographic objects allowing location queries to be run in SQL.

```sql
SELECT superhero.name
FROM city, superhero
WHERE ST_Contains(city.geom, superhero.geom)
AND city.name = 'Gotham';
```

In addition to basic location awareness, PostGIS offers many features rarely found in other competing spatial databases such as Oracle Locator/Spatial and SQL Server. Refer to [PostGIS Feature List](http://postgis.net/features/) for more details.

PostGIS dependencies are installed and PostGIS extension is available for Dingo PostgreSQLâ„¢ service instances.
