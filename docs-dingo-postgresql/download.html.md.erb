Today, there is a Dingobot waiting to give you a download link for the Dingo PostgreSQL™ tile. We want to welcome you into our "Ask for help" Slack channel, get your download link, and say Hello!

1. Go to https://slack.dingotiles.com/ to get a FREE invite to our **Dingo Tiles™ - Ask for Help** Slack account.
2. Say hello! Some of us live all around the world and fingers crossed there is someone who will say hello back!
3. Type `/download-postgresql` to talk to the Dingobot and request a download URL. You can do this in any channel.

    You can click on this link to download the tile.

    Publicly, the little Dingobot will celebrate the occasion:

    The URL is valid for a few minutes. If you need a new URL, you can type `/download-postgresql` again.

4. We are very happy to help you (we like screensharing via [Zoom](https://zoom.us)) to get the Dingo PostgreSQL™ tile installed and connected to your AWS account.

    We have also written up an [Installation](installation.html) guide.

5. We are also happy to help your developers to use the tile and to write to the Amazon PostgreSQL API.

    We have also written up guides to [Provisioning &amp; Binding](usage-provision.html) and have [example applications](lang-examples.html).

6. Come back to Slack any time to ask for help or advice about our products or Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg; in general.

7. Please suggest improvements, or make suggestions for other Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg; products that you would like us to create for you.

7. Our Sales team will follow up to ensure you are very happy and to arrange payment for the Dingo PostgreSQL™ product.
