title: Overview of Dingo Redis for Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg;
---

![tile](images/dingo-redis-tile.png)

Nearly all applications running on Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg; benefit from caching expensive results, or the use of a pub/sub system. The best open source solution for both use cases is [Redis](http://www.redis.io/).

The Dingo Redis tile brings Redis to everyone in your organization. New staff on their first day will find it simple to get started. Each service instance is a dedicated Redis key-value store running in secure isolation inside a Linux container.

It is easier to use Dingo Redis for Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg; than not to:

```
cf create-service dingo-redis ready my-first-redis
cf bind-service myapp my-first-redis
cf restart myapp
```

## Support

Dingo Redis is an orchestration platform for open source Redis, including the latest stable 3.2 release. The entire Dingo Tiles™ team will do whatever is necessary to help your team get started, to be successful, and to avoid running into production issues.

If your company has in-house database administrators (DBAs), experts or people who are willing to read Redis manuals and tutorials, then they will have the ability to connect to each database cluster with superuser privileges.

3rd party Redis support organizations are also welcome to assist with Redis support for one or more of your databases. [Contact Dingo Tiles™ team](contact.html) for suggestions.
