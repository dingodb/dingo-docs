## v0.5.1

Dingo Redis can now be installed in offline mode. The tile bakes the specific Docker image version into the tile, and it is directly injected into each Docker Backend instance. No Docker Registry nor Internet access is required to installed Dingo Redis v0.5.1 and above.

Binding credentials now include both `host` and `hostname` keys containing the IP address.

## v0.5

Used in production since 2015, this is the initial release for Pivotal Network.

This release does not yet include support for archives and disaster recovery. We definitely promise this is coming.
