# Documentation for Dingo Tilesâ„¢

## Adding documentation pages

To allow new pages to be discovered they should be also added to the navigation sidebar for that section.

For example, for `dingo-s3` there is `docs-book/master_middleman/source/subnavs/_dingo_s3_subnav.erb`.

Add an HTML snippet into an appropriate place within the subnav:

```html
<li class="menu-link">
  <a href="/dingo-s3/new-page.html">New page of information</a>
</li>
```

## Deployment

There is a CI pipeline setup to automatically deploy any new changes to the documentation site.
