Very soon we will publish a centralized backup and restore facility for Dingo Shield and other similar Dingo Tiles (not including Dingo PostgreSQL which includes its own continuous archiving system). Dingo Shield will then be extended with the Dingo Tiles `bosh run errand disaster-recovery` super tool.

Each Dingo Shield service instance is provisioned on-demand inside a dedicated Docker container. The service does not yet support the notion of "dedicated server" model of Shield. Please contact us to discuss if you have this specific requirement.
