* Each service instance (SI) only supports provisioning a single topic
* No additional authentication nor authorization is included with each set of credentials to Kafka, beyond the random unique GUID for the topic name
* Kafka Manager is not automatically configured for the zookeeper/kafka cluster deployed by Dingo Kafka. [See instructions for manually setup](admin-kafka-manager.html).

## Installation help

If Dingo Kafka tile fails to install, check the Installation Logs.

Check if the bottom of the logs looks similar to `Could not find service redis-for-kafka to bind to dingo-kafka-broker`:

```

If this is the case then you have not yet installed the Dingo Redis tile.

1. You must delete the Dingo Kafka tile. It is important that the Dingo Redis tile is already installed successfully before installing Dingo Kafka.

2. Install the Dingo Redis tile.

3. Install Dingo Kafka tile again.
