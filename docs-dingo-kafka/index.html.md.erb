Apache Kafka™ is used for building real-time data pipelines and streaming apps. It is horizontally scalable, fault-tolerant, wicked fast, and runs in production in thousands of companies. Dingo Kafka is an orchestration of Apache Kafka for the Pivotal Cloud Foundry platform.

The Dingo Kafka tile brings Kafka to everyone in your organization. New staff on their first day will find it simple to get started. Each service instance is a Kafka topic to which an application can subscribe or publish.

Apache Kafka has many [use cases](https://kafka.apache.org/uses): messaging, activity tracking, metrics, log aggregation, stream processing, event sourcing, and commit log.

It is easier to use Dingo Kafka for Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg; than not to:

```
cf create-service dingo-kafka topic my-first-kafka
cf bind-service myapp my-first-kafka
cf restart myapp
```

## Support

Dingo Kafka is an orchestration platform for open source Apache Kafka, including the latest 0.10 releases. The entire Dingo Tiles™ team will do whatever is necessary to help your team get started, to be successful, and to avoid running into production issues.

If your company has in-house database administrators (DBAs), experts or people who are willing to read Kafka manuals and tutorials, then they will have the ability to connect to each database cluster with superuser privileges.

3rd party Kafka support organizations are also welcome to assist with Kafka support for one or more of your databases. [Contact Dingo Tiles™ team](contact.html) for suggestions.
