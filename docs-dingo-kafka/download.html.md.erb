Today, there is a Dingobot waiting to give you a download link for the Dingo Kafka tile. We want to welcome you into our "Ask for help" Slack channel, get your download link, and say Hello!

1. Go to https://slack.dingotiles.com/ to get a FREE invite to our **Dingo Tilesâ„¢ - Ask for Help** Slack account.
2. Say hello! Some of us live all around the world and fingers crossed there is someone who will say hello back!
3. Type `/download-kafka` to talk to the Dingobot and request a download URL. You can do this in any channel.

    Privately, only you will see the following:

    You can click on this link to download the tile.

    The URL is valid for a few minutes. If you need a new URL, you can type `/download-kafka` again.

4. We are very happy to help you (we like screensharing via [Zoom](https://zoom.us)) to get the Dingo Kafka tile installed.

    We have also written up an [Installation](installation.html) guide.

5. Come back to Slack any time to ask for help or advice about our products or Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg; in general.

6. Please suggest improvements, or make suggestions for other Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg; products that you would like us to create for you.

7. Our Sales team will follow up to ensure you are very happy and to arrange payment for the Dingo Kafka product.
