## <a id="dingo-secrets-logs"></a>Dingo Secrets™ logs

Dingo Secrets™ is installed as an application running on your Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg; in the `system` organization.

You can use the `cf logs` command to see recent or incoming logs:

```
cf t -o system -s dingo-secrets
cf logs dingo-secrets --recent
cf logs dingo-secrets
```

## <a id="dingo-secrets-credentials"></a>Dingo Secrets™ credentials

To confirm which AWS credentials are being used, and other internally configured UUIDs, AWS prefixes, secrets, etc, look at the environment variables for the `dingo-secrets` application:

```
cf t -o system -s dingo-secrets
cf env dingo-secrets
```

The output will include something like:

```
User-Provided:
AWS_ACCESS_KEY: XXXX
AWS_SECRET_KEY: YYYY
vault_NAME_PREFIX: dingo-secrets
GROUP_NAME_PREFIX: dingo-secrets
GROUP_PATH: /dingo-secrets/
PLAN_ID: generated-uuid
POLICY_NAME_PREFIX: dingo-secrets
SECURITY_USER_NAME: user
SECURITY_USER_PASSWORD: generated-password
SERVICE_ID: generated-uuid
SERVICE_NAME: dingo-secrets
USER_NAME_PREFIX: dingo-secrets
USER_PATH: /dingo-secrets/
```

The secrets/UUIDs are generated by Ops Manager when the Dingo Secrets™ tile was first installed into Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg;.

Click on the "Dingo Secrets™" tile to edit it; then select the "Credentials" tab to see the credentials generated by Ops Manager.

## <a id="amazon-Secrets-console"></a>Amazon Secrets console

With Dingo Secrets™ users/developers/CI systems can autonomously create new Dingo Secrets vaults, and their applications can read/write objects to those vaults.

As an administrator you may be requested to help perform Amazon Secrets administration tasks.

First, you will want to determine the Dingo Secrets vault name for a developer's Dingo Secrets™ service instance.

Secondly, you will want to log into the AWS Web Console, and find their vault. You can then use the AWS Web Console to perform tasks

### <a id="determine-vault-names"></a>Determining vault names

To help any user you will need to identify which Pivotal Elastic Runtime organization & space they are working within. As an admin you can then target that space:

```
cf target -o users-org -s users-space
```

The user needs to also tell you the service instance name for their Dingo Secrets™ vault. It will be `users-vault` in examples below.

To get the list of available service instances:

```
cf services
```

The output will look similar to:

```
Getting services in org users-org / space users-space as admin...
OK

name           service    plan        bound apps          last operation
users-vault   dingo-secrets   essential   users-application   create succeeded
```

You can only discover the Dingo Secrets vault name once the service instance has been bound to at least one application.

You can now use the [`jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) CLI tool and some advanced use of the `cf curl` subcommand to discover the Dingo Secrets vault name and API credentials.

```
service_instance_name="users-vault"
space_guid=$(cat ~/.cf/config.json | jq -r ".SpaceFields.Guid")
cf curl $(cf curl /v2/spaces/${space_guid}/service_instances\?q=name:${service_instance_name} | jq -r ".resources[0].entity.service_bindings_url")
```

The output will look similar too:

```json
{
   "total_results": 1,
   "total_pages": 1,
   "prev_url": null,
   "next_url": null,
   "resources": [
      {
         "metadata": {
            "guid": "22870f9b-4619-451d-befc-3f943fb53575",
            "url": "/v2/service_bindings/22870f9b-4619-451d-befc-3f943fb53575",
            "created_at": "2016-02-17T05:31:50Z",
            "updated_at": null
         },

            "app_guid": "b2c3096b-51b3-4eb7-bd05-3d4e29983f9f",
            "service_instance_guid": "5cb4169b-cd93-4fd1-97ec-77a253eeea49",
            "credentials": {
              "vault": "dingo-secrets-5cb4169b-cd93-4fd1-97ec-77a253eeea4X",
              "access_key_id": "AKIAJDKOBK2LGAKJSC6X",
              "secret_access_key": "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",
              "username": "dingo-secrets-22870f9b-4619-451d-befc-3f943fb5357X"
            },
            "binding_options": {},
            "gateway_data": null,
            "gateway_name": "",
            "syslog_drain_url": null,
            "app_url": "/v2/apps/b2c3096b-51b3-4eb7-bd05-3d4e29983f9f",
            "service_instance_url": "/v2/service_instances/5cb4169b-cd93-4fd1-97ec-77a253eeea49"
         }
      }
   ]
}
```

In the middle are the service binding credentials:

```json
"credentials": {
   "vault": "dingo-secrets-5cb4169b-cd93-4fd1-97ec-77a253eeea4X",
   "access_key_id": "AKIAJDKOBK2LGAKJSC6X",
   "secret_access_key": "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",
   "username": "dingo-secrets-22870f9b-4619-451d-befc-3f943fb5357X"
},
```

The `vault` value is the globally unique Dingo Secrets vault name (`dingo-secrets-5cb4169b-cd93-4fd1-97ec-77a253eeea4X` in this example).
